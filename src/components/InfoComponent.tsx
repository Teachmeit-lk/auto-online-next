        Autoonline.lk is a platform where customers and buyers meet online and
        exchange product information and prices. Delivery of goods from the
        supplier&apos;s location to the customer&apos;s location should be
        organized by the customer and supplier at their convenience, either by
        way of pickup or delivery. Autoonline.lk has no responsibility for the
        delivery of goods from the supplier location to the customer location.
        The charge for deliveries is decided by the supplier based on the size
        of the product, distance, and mode of transportation.
