        Auto Online is a web portal, which facilitate buyers, suppliers and
        service providers to meet in an online flatform. Buyers can search for
        suitable suppliers for the vehicle parts or services they require.

        services. <br />
        <br />
        There is no joining fee or subscription fee for a supplier to register
        and publish his company name and product information on autoonline.lk.
        Registered suppliers will receive customer requirements on their
        WhatsApp account. Buyers log on to autoonline.lk and search for
        suppliers. Once the buyer finds a suitable supplier, the buyer can share
        the requirement along with the product description and a related photo
        of the defected item.
        <br />
        <br />
        With reference to the buyer's inquiry, suppliers can check for the
        availability of the requested item and make their own quotations using
        the quotation software provided on the autoonline.lk website. Based on
        the supplier's quotation, if the customer chooses to purchase from the
        supplier, the customer can place the order online and pay via the
        payment gateway to the supplier, or can choose cash on delivery. Auto
        Online has no delivery system, it is a collective responsibility between
        the customer and the supplier.
